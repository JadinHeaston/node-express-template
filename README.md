# Node Express Template

This is a template for starting a Node.js and Express.js application for my own personal use.

## Usage

Built in are two commands:
    - ```npm run dev```
        - This version will constantly restart the server whenever a change is made to any TypeScript file, while also compiling the files into JS before serving.
    - ```npm run prod```
        - Using the productions version will perform a single TypeScript compilation before running a single time.
